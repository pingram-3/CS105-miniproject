My contributions to our CS105 mini project.
Contains visualizations I created along with their explanations.

In this project, we performed EDA and generated visualizations for a survey taken by around 200 students enrolled in various Computer Science courses offered at UCR. The survey consisted of various questions based on lifestyle and academics. For our project, we specifically wanted to explore relationships between stress ratings and possible correlating factors like diet, commuting distance, and extracurricular involvement.
