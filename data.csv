Using it to understand concepts, improve your skills, or get guidance on how to approach a problem is arguably the most ethical way to use AI right now.

If you're stuck on a coding problem or confused by an error message, I think it's perfectly fine to ask ChatGPT for advice or direction. However, if you end up using a solution provided by ChatGPT, you should credit it in a comment, along with a brief note of what you asked. This helps you stay transparent, honest, and avoid any accusations of plagiarism.

Whether or not a professor specifically allows it is a separate issue, but in general, students should not be punished for academic dishonesty if they're honest about how they used AI support.

tldr:
I think it's okay to use ChatGPT like a tutor to learn and solve problems, but always credit any material you copy to protect yourself and maintain academic integrity.","If we define cheating as copying and pasting from ChatGPT without crediting, one scenario where I feel it would be acceptable is when using ChatGPT like a calculator to perform calculations that could also be done by an expensive device — assuming the professor allows those devices. The goal isn't to misrepresent ones abilities but simply to complete mechanical work faster, just like using a calculator or spreadsheet would.

My thought process is that it’s the same reason why you aren't required to sign your calculator as a co-author on tests, nor cite any of the work you typed in or received from it.
